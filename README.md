# jsPiano üéµ

> Ever wanted to learn how to play the piano but either can't afford a real one? Well why not give jsPiano a try and unlock your hidden musical talents. _Disclaimer: Does not actually teach you how to play the piano_ üòÅ.

The goals of this project were as follows:
  1. Using only HTML, CSS & JS, create a site that allows a user to play a musical instrument
  2. Demonstrate the ability to capture input and produce appropriate output

I picked the piano because I'm attempting to learn that myself (semi-successfully) so just felt appropriate. The challenge however was to be able to fit the necessary amount of keys in a way that would make sense to the user. I settled on using the middle row of keys on the keyboard (a-#) for the major keys, and using the above row for the minor keys (trying to match them to their major equivalent where possible). This resulted in a note range of e3 to b4. Admittedly not the deepest key range, but it is at least able to accomplish the aims of the project.
